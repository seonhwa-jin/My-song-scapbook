            There ain't no gold
        In this river<br>
        That I've been washing my hands in forever<br>
        I know there is hope<br>
        In these waters<br>
        But I can't bring myself to swim<br>
        When I am drowning<br>
        In this silence baby let me in<br>
        <p style="margin-top:40px;"><strong>Go easy on me baby</strong>
        I was still a child<br>
        Didn't get the chance to<br>
        Feel the world around me<br>
        I had no time to choose<br>
        What I chose to do<br>
        So go easy on me</p>
        <p style="margin-top:40px;">There ain't no room<br>
        For things to change<br>
        When we are both so deeply<br>
        Stuck in our ways<br>
        You can't deny how hard I have tried<br>
        I changed who I was<br>
        To put you both first<br>
        But now I give up</p>
        <p style="margin-top:40px;">
        Go easy on me baby<br>
        I was still a child<br>
        Didn't get the chance to<br>
        Feel the world around me<br>
        I had no time to choose<br>
        What I chose to do<br>
        So go easy on me<br>
        I had good intentions<br>
        And the highest hopes<br>
        But I know right now<br>
        It probably doesn't even show</p>
        <p style="margin-top:40px;">
        Go easy on me baby<br>
        I was still a child<br>
        Didn't get the chance to<br>
        Feel the world around me<br>
        I had no time to choose<br>
        What I chose to do<br>
        So go easy on me</p>
