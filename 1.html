    I see you in the morning
    Feel your fingers in my hair
    Sometimes I still pretend you're there
    It hits me without warning
    Your reflection walking by
    But I know it's only in my mind<br><br>
    Will you show me the piece of my heart
    I've been missing?
    Won't you give me the part of myself
    That I can't give back?
    Will you show me the piece of my heart
    I've been missing?
    <u>'Cause I'd kill for you
    And darling you know that</u>
    So I'll light up a cigarette
    I'll drink it down 'til there's nothing left
    'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
    And lord knows there's no relief
    <strong>You held my heart in your fingertips</strong>
    So now I drown in my bitterness
    Oh I can't get no sleep
    And I sure won't I sure won't find no peace
    No peace
    <p style="margin-top:40px;">All that I am asking is for a little clarity
    That's all that really matters to me
    In and out of focus tears are in my eyes
    We're burning down the bridges this time
    Will you show me the piece of my heart
    I've been missing?
    Won't you give me the part of myself
    That I can't give back?
    Will you show me the piece of my heart
    I've been missing?
    'Cause I'd kill for you
    And darling you know that</p>
    So I'll light up a cigarette
    I'll drink it down 'til there's nothing left
    'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
    And lord knows there's no relief
    You held my heart in your fingertips
    So now I drown in my bitterness
    Oh I can't get no sleep
    And I sure won't I sure won't find
    I used to find comfort in your arms
    Caught up in the wonder of your charms
    Oh I'll cry for you I'll cry for you
    I'll die for you I'll die for you
    But I don't even know you anymore
    So I'll light up a cigarette
    I'll drink it down 'til there's nothing left
    'Cause I sure can't get no sleep
    And lord knows there's no relief
    You held my heart in your fingertips
    So now I drown in my bitterness
    Oh I can't get no sleep
    And I sure won't I sure won't find no peace
    Sure won't find no peace no no
    Will you give me the piece
    Will you give me the piece of my heart?
    Will you give me the piece
    Will you give me the piece of my heart
